# How it All Started

It was in October of 2019 when I attended the FrenchKit conference for the third
time. The first, I was an attendee (I think this was the second conference I
went to ever!), the second time was my first presentation at a conference.

Having attended, given a talk... in 2019 I gave a workshop on iPadOS; the same
workshop I gave at [Swift Island](https://swiftisland.nl) earlier that year.

Then at the end of the conference, the speakers gathered on stage, took a
picture, and then we were invited in the back (I think we were given a bottle
of wine as gift... which I gave away as I don't drink, nor could I take it with
me on the plane).

It's there that I was talking to [Antoine van der Lee](https://twitter.com/twannl),
who told me [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws) had invited him to
contribute a chapter for a book! This sounded amazing, and thus I asked him if
Paul was still looking for other contributors. He said go for it, so I sent Paul
a message... and before I knew it, I was going to write a book chapter!
Exciting!

# Swift for Good

The book we wrote wasn't just any book — it was the first volume of [Swift for
Good](https://www.swiftforgood.com), a book with 100% of all revenue going to
charity. I am still so proud of the result, and perhaps even more so of the
team work and effort that went into making this project a great success.

The way we wrote this book is through git. While perhaps not the first thing I'd
think of when writing a book, I would never ever want to do this another way.
Git (and GitHub) made the whole process so much fun — from using Markdown, to
doing pull request reviews on our chapters, working together like in open source
for a fantastic end result.

# Choosing a Topic

One of the things I remember vividly, is that the authors where all invited to
the GitHub repository, and we were to all chose a topic. [Kaya Thomas](https://twitter.com/kthomas901)
was one of the other authors, and I could see her choose accessibility as a
topic... One I was also interested in. I ended up going with it, and Kaya
chose to write about testing; my "backup" topic. I reached out to her, and we
ended up exchanging thoughts and reviewing each other's chapter.

# Writing the Chapter

To some extent, writing a chapter for a book like this, where every chapter
covers a different topic, feels like writing a well structured, long blog post.
And yet, it _feels_ different. Sure, there is more pressure and more "on the
line" writing for a book. But what helped here, is that with the goal of as
much of the revenue going directly to charity, it is only available in a digital
format. That means that we could fix typos (or even update chapters) where
necessary.

So it is December 2019; I was at home, as I took my remaining vacation days for
the year. I, like I [prepare for a presentation](/preparing-presentations),
took notes and outlined what I wanted to cover in this chapter. Then it was
time to write. It reminded me of writing my thesis — it really helped me to be
in a different location where I could focus on writing. That location ended up
being a combination of the restaurant at the golf course, and the local coffee
shop.

It was so exciting to write the chapter, and the closer I got to finishing it,
as well as seeing others write their chapters, the more energy I had to finish
it. And I'm really proud of the result!

# Closing Thoughts

Writing this book chapter started as a coincidental chat with a friend. It
ended up with me working together with people I'd not worked with before, and
together craft a project that made great impact.

I'm looking forward to an eventual Volume 2, and perhaps another writing
opportunity in the future, too.
