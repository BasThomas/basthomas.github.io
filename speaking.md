I like public speaking and giving workshops, sharing my thoughts and
perspective on iOS, Swift and more.

Topics I am particularly interested in include communication, accessibility,
testability, open source, and the Swift.org project (and its evolution process).
This is not an exhaustive list and may change over time.

If you are interested in me giving a workshop or speaking at your event, please
get in touch.
