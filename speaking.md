title: Speaking & Workshops
permalink: /speaking/
---

I like public speaking and giving workshops, sharing my thoughts and
perspective on iOS, Swift and programming.

Topics I am particularly interested in include accessibility, inclusive design,
testability, open source, and the Swift.org project (and its evolution process).
This is not an exhaustive list and may change over time.

If you are interested in me giving a workshop or speaking at your event, please
get in touch.

Bas is an iOS developer with a passion for testability, accessibility and
user-centric apps. He cares about communication and collaboration.

talks about things on the <a href="https://contravariance.rocks">Contravariance podcast</a>,
and works on various open source projects, like <a href="http://githawk.com">GitHawk</a>.

Coffee is nice. Watches are cool.
