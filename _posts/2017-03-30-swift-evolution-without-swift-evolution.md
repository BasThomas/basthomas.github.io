An [interesting few tweets](https://twitter.com/BasThomas/status/845737912436228104) from the Swift team's [Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) confirmed something I have been thinking of pretty much since Swift was open sourced.

`swift-evolution` is great, but takes *a lot* of time for the Swift Core Team - or even too much.

<!--more-->

To me, it seems like a temporary halt to `swift-evolution` would be very welcome. This gives the Swift Core Team more time and concentration to solve issues that they would've liked to address a long time ago: ABI stability (!), fixing crashes, improving error messaging, improving compile times, paying off technical debt...

Sure, halting `swift-evolution` doesn't magically solve all these "problems", but I think it can give more room and focus on deferred work.

Maybe there will even be time to look into [this Discourse thing](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170206/031657.html), which would improve the `swift-evolution` process in the future...
