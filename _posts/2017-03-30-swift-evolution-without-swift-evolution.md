title:  "Swift Evolution without swift-evolution"

An interesting few tweets from the Swift team's [Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) confirmed something I have been thinking of pretty much since Swift was open sourced.

`swift-evolution` is great, but takes *a lot* of time from both the Swift Core Team and developers writing a proposal.

And, according to Slava, it has already had quite an impact during the development of Swift 3.

To me, it seems like a temporary halt to `swift-evolution` would be very welcome. This gives the Swift Core Team more time and concentration to solve issues that they would've liked to address a long time ago: ABI (!), fixing crashes, improving error messaging and compile times.

Sure, halting `swift-evolution` doesn't magically solve all the "problems", but I think it can create some focus on deferred work.

Maybe there will even be time to look into [this Discourse thing](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170206/031657.html), which would improve the swift-evolution process in the future...
