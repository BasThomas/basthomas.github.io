Now that you have a good idea on how to improve your app for VoiceOver, you may
wonder if there are other options to test and verify it apart from manually
testing on a device.

Well, good news: there are a bunch of options to test your accessibility-related
code. Let's take a look at the Accessibility Inspector.

## Introduction

Accessibility Inspector is an app that comes bundled with Xcode, alongside other
apps like the Simulator and Instruments. As the name suggests, the accessibility
inspector lets you inspect apps, scanning its accessibility elements to get a
better understanding (or to verify) its accessibility.

Apart from (manually) inspecting apps, the Accessibility Inspector comes with
an automated audit tool, an (accessibility) notification console, and a color
contrast calculator. It's quite packed!

## Inspection

To inspect elements in apps, start by choosing your device â€” by default the Mac
the inspector is running on. You can (and should) change that to the appropriate
device, like the simulator or your (wirelessly) connected device. When
inspecting on macOS, also make sure to pick the process you want to inspect.

On the Mac, you'll be presented with multiple sections:

- **Basic**, which includes the elements label, title, value, and type;
- **Actions**, including all accessibility actions (which you can activate from
within the app!);
- **Catalyst** shows, when inspecting a Catalyst app, the underlying iOS-based
information for accessibility;
- The **advanced** view shows you a bunch more information, from the element's
size to its help text;
- **Element** gives you the element's class;
- **Hierarchy** shows the hierarchy of the siblings of the inspect element, as
well as its parents. In the menu bar, you can show _ignored elements_ by going
to `Inspection > Show Ignored Elements`.

When inspecting on the simulator, or an iOS device, the sections are mostly the
same, yet missing the "advanced" view... which is a shame, as it houses a bunch
of useful information that would also be interesting to inspect for iOS apps.
Alas.

### Custom Content

Custom Content, unfortunately, can't be checked using the inspector (FB9824602),
making it a bit trickier to verify. A shame, as it can really improve the
accessibility experience.

What you _could_ do, is to a) verify on-device, or b) by enabling macOS
VoiceOver, navigating to the view (including the iOS-view in the simulator),
and using the VoiceOver modifier keys + command + `/`; note that the latter
requires macOS Monterey or later.

## Audit

With the Accessibility Audit, you can run an audit on a specific view. By
default, it scans **element descriptions**, **hit regions**, **contrast**,
**element detection**, **parent/child relationships** and **actions** on Mac,
and on iOS, **element descriptions**, **contrast**, **hit regions**, **element
detection**, **clipped text**, **traits** and **large text**.

Running an audit can be a fantastic way to get an overview of what can be done
to make a specific view more accessible. While it isn't guaranteed to point out
_everything_, it will most certainly give you some good indications of what can
be improved, from color contrast issues labels duplicating information included
through traits.

## Notification Console

In the Accessibility Inspector's menu bar, go to `Window > Show Notifications`
to open the notification console. This console polls for accessibility
notifications an app sends out, and can help you debug accessibility issues
that are relying on notifications, like moving an assistive technology's pointer
focus or announcements.

## Color Contrast Calculator

In the menu bar, there's another tool: `Window > Show Color Contrast Calculator`
opens a window with a tool to calculate color contrast for text on a background.
Useful to check if those custom (brand) colors you're using pass the expected
color contrast.

## Conclusion

The Accessibility Inspector gives you a great tool to better understand
accessibility in your app, allowing you to verify information without needing
a physical (iOS) device. Aside from the manual verification it allows, it comes
with a built-in audit that gives you a rundown of a certain view's
accessibility.

From here, with your app starting to become more accessible, and insights on
how to verify it, you may want to (further) look into testing certain parts
of accessibility with unit and/or UI tests.

Let me know your thoughts on this post, and if you have any questions,
I'd love to help!
