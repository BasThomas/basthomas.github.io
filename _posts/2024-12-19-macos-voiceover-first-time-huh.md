You may have used or tried out using a screen reader on a mobile device, but
what about on a desktop?

<!--more-->

I'm going to be honest — the first time I used VoiceOver on macOS, I felt
overwhelmed and felt like there was quite the learning curve. But a lot of that
was due to me not having taken the time to _think_ about screen readers in an
environment away from touch screen, and I had many assumptions about that being
"the way" to navigate using a screen reader.

# Humble Beginnings

No touch screen it is. On desktop, the keyboard is going to be our main form of
input.

To turn on VoiceOver, use ⌘ (command) + F5, or ⌘ + triple-click Touch ID.
Do the same to turn it off again.

At the core of VoiceOver on macOS, you have what's called the VoiceOver
modifier. By default, it's set to ⌃⌥ (control + option) _or_ ⇪ (Caps Lock).

Like you'd use control, option, command etc. on their own or in combinations
for keyboard shortcuts, you use the VoiceOver modifier together with other keys,
like arrows, to navigate. Just like keyboard shortcuts!

<br />
_You'll often see "VoiceOver modifier" be referred to simply as "VO". "VO right
arrow", then, may refer to using your VoiceOver modifier keys together with
right arrow._

---
<br />
Where on touch screens, we use a single-finger right swipe to navigate to an
item on the right, on macOS we'd do that with VO + right arrow.

To navigate to an item on the left, use VO + left arrow.

# Hierarchy

On touch screen devices, you're likely used to a flat navigation style. This
is the default. There is also an option for _grouped_ navigation, which
navigates between _groups_ (I _think_ this translates to navigating by
_container_), then requires a two-finger swipe right to "enter" the group.

A two-finger swipe left exits the group.

On macOS, the grouping behavior by default is similar to _grouped_. What that
means in practice is you'll have to enter and exit groups, like scroll views
by default.

<br />
_This is also why it is important to label your scoll views! The Messages app's
detail view is labeled "Conversations", for example._

<br />
To enter a group, use VO + ⇧ (shift) + down arrow. Exiting a group? VO + ⇧ + up
arrow. But you guessed that.

Activating elements like a button is done using VO + space.

# What's Next

This should allow you to get started using VoiceOver on macOS. But there's more!
Way more. Rotors and Commands are just two of them.

Furthermore, VoiceOver Utility is your one-shop-stop to set up VoiceOver to your
liking, from the Voice used, to the Caption Panel showing, to the Braille Panel,
to setting up VoiceOver to use with a trackpad.

Go and try it out — I'd love to hear how you get on!
