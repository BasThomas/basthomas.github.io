It has almost been three years since Jesse announced [stepping down](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/2017/12/28/swift-weekly-brief-hiatus/)
from writing the Swift Weekly Brief, a newsletter he [started](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/2016/01/14/new-weekly-brief/)
soon after Swift was open sourced in December 2015.

In January 2018, soon after he stepped down, [I took over the project](/curating-swift-weekly).
Since then, I've been curating the (since then biweekly) newsletter, with a lot
of help from [Kristaps Grinbergs](https://twitter.com/fassko).

After an amazing almost three years of curating the newsletter, I've also, like
Jesse did in the past, decided to move on from the project. Similarly, I would
love for the community to take over the project and keep more than 10.000
developers in the loop of what's going on in the Swift.org and other Apple
open source projects.

We will be shutting down the mailing list after issue 170.

You can help out in some specific ways: posting interesting links and forum
posts to the [meta-issues](https://github.com/SwiftWeekly/swiftweekly.github.io/issues/546)
we create, and to write (part of) the newsletter. All of this has been
documented in our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/SwiftWeekly/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Please [get in touch](https://twitter.com/basthomas) if you're interested â€” I'm
more than happy to answer any questions you might have.

Thank you to everyone involved in this project, and specifically [Jesse](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires)
for starting this project, and [Kristaps](https://twitter.com/fassko) for the
immense help for the last months.
And to all of you who've read the newsletter, learned from it, and shared it
with others.

I'm so proud of what we've been able to accomplish. It's been an amazing
experience, and an honor.

[Until next time](https://open.spotify.com/track/2X4Cj5zIdnav7767iPiDou?si=xu_vI8hqQdKPsECqSggUUg),
