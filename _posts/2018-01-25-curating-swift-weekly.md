I am delighted to tell you that I will be taking over the curation role for [Swift Weekly Brief](https://swiftweekly.github.io) from [Jesse Squires](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires).

Jesse [stepped down](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/swift-weekly-brief-hiatus/) after an amazing 100 issues. 💯🎉
He built an amazing newsletter capturing everything ongoing in the Swift.org projects.

I started contributing to Swift Weekly in August 2016, and after meeting Jesse at [FrenchKit](http://frenchkit.fr) in September that year, I wrote my [first issue](https://swiftweekly.github.io/issue-42/) on October 13th, and have been contributing regularly since.

I think it's fair to say that I love the project, which is why I approached Jesse to take over the curation. I know that Swift Weekly is a valuable resource for many iOS developers who want to stay up to date with what's happening around the Swift.org projects -- including me.

That's why I chose to curate the issues to come, aiming to keep not only you, the reader, but also myself up to speed with these amazing open source projects.

Having said that, I want to give a big thank-you to all contributors and [authors](https://swiftweekly.github.io/authors/). All have done a fantastic job keeping the project fresh and up-to-date.

Last but not least, I want to quote Jesse:

> The newsletter is definitely a valuable resource for the community, and if you want to help it live on, it will have a huge impact. There are thousands of followers and subscribers.

Please let us know if you want to keep this project going - be it by contributing (that'd be awesome, I'd love to help!) or by sharing your excitement with a tweet.

Looking forward to an amazing future of this project! 🏎
