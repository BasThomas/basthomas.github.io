Nice to meet you. ðŸ‘‹

I build applications, tooling and more for Apple platforms. I love doing sports,
contributing to open source software & [public speaking](/speaking).

You may also know me from [Swift Weekly Brief](https://swiftweekly.github.io)
or the [Contravariance](https://contravariance.rocks) podcast.

You can find my resume [on this site](/curriculum-vitae).
