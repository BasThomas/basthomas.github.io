Nice to meet you. 👋

I build applications and tooling for Apple platforms. I love doing sports, contributing to
OSS & [public speaking](/speaking).

You may also know me from [Swift Weekly Brief](https://swiftweekly.github.io)
or the [Contravariance](https://contravariance.rocks) podcast.

You can find my CV [on this site](/curriculum-vitae).
