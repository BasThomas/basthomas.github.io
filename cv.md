## Introduction
I am a software developer from The Netherlands, currently living in Germany. I love sharing knowledge
and learning from others at conferences, and enjoy [speaking and giving workshops](/speaking.md/).

In the summer of 2016 I worked at Bringme, a company solving the pain points of online shopping, delivering your items to boxes instead of at home. Here, I made a proof of concept, native iOS app, at a point the company was considering a switch from hybrid to native development. They chose native, and released their native apps for iOS and Android in May 2017.

During my time at Apostle, a Dutch company looking to "implement and maintain your company's and employees' social media", I not only built an iOS application that enables users to create posts for multiple social media platforms, but I have also been doing QA for both their web products and apps, as well as some "get started" guides for their tools.

*February 2016 ‚Äì current*

Concerts is an app, written in Swift, providing touring information for the artists you know and love.

The app lets you "follow" artists and see when and where they are touring, RSVP to events, and even buy tickets right from the app.

I have been conducting code reviews for this application, as well as providing (English) localization and doing QA.

#### [tvOS Guidelines Quick Reference](https://github.com/BasThomas/tvOS-guidelines)
Right after Apple TV 4 was released, I dove into its (Interface) Guidelines and made a quick reference guide, using images and checklists to easily visualise and navigate it.

## Education

#### [Fontys University of Applied Sciences](http://fontys.edu) *September 2013 ‚Äì July 2017*, Eindhoven

At Fontys, I studied studying ICT & Software, with a focus on Mobile. Here, I have been working with C#, Java, relational databases, Swift, Java for Android and more.

#### [Delta](http://deltafhict.nl/home/?lang=en)
Delta is a Fontys initiative providing what could be called an excellence programme for students:

>"Students who participate in the Delta programme work on their own goals and interests. This may work on ‚Äòexploration projects‚Äô, where they are given full freedom to explore a new technology or technique such as Google Glass, Drones, Virtual Reality and 3D printing. But this can also be collaborating on projects for real clients."

Here, I made [Opus](http://deltafhict.github.io/mirror-docs/), a Smart Mirror, making use of technologies as Leap Motion, Kinect and more. This project went through a full software architecture - from concepting to realisation.

#### [Avans University of Applied Sciences](http://www.avans.nl/international) *September 2012 ‚Äì July 2013*, 's Hertogenbosch

At Avans, I studied ICT / Information Technology, working mostly with Java. I also learned about software modelling, relational databases and ITIL.

#### [Philips - HAVO, N&T](http://www.pvanhorne.nl) *September 2007 ‚Äì June 2012*, Weert

In highschool, I graduated with a curriculum based on Nature and Engineering.

#### [Bilingual Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilingual_education#Netherlands)
In highschool, we had an option to follow "Bilingual Education", in which roughly 50% of all courses were conducted in English.

Concluding this special field of study, I finished my [Anglia Advanced Exam](http://www.anglia.org).

#### [International Baccalaureate English](http://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/curriculum/language-and-literature/)
The last two years of highschool, I followed an International Baccalaureate English and finished its exam.

## Other experience

#### Open Source Software
I ‚ù§Ô∏è OSS. The collaboration it enables is truly wonderful. That's why I like to contribute to projects I use and love, making them even better.

Some projects I have been involved in:

#### [Swift Weekly Brief](https://swiftweekly.github.io/)
Bringing you an overview of what's been happing in open source Swift every Thursday. I've been contributing content as well as writing [some](https://swiftweekly.github.io/issue-47/) full [issues](https://swiftweekly.github.io/issue-42/).

It's on [GitHub](https://github.com/SwiftWeekly/swiftweekly.github.io).

#### [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya)
Moya is a network abstraction layer written in Swift. I've been contributing to this project by making their documentation even more awesome, as well as helping out users with any issues they might have.

#### [GitHawk](https://itunes.apple.com/app/githawk-for-github/id1252320249)

GitHawk is a small iOS app that makes managing GitHub accounts and projects a little easier. I've been contributing to this app in a couple of ways, such as improving its accessibility, writing blog posts and much more.

Check ou the app on [GitHub](https://github.com/rnystrom/GitHawk).

#### [try! Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/try!/id1083944488?mt=8)
[try! Swift](https://www.tryswift.co/) is a Swift conference held in multiple cities around the world.

I am currently enhancing the iOS app for the conference to be more flexible and more easily usable.

For example, I have rewritten the app to enable the use of JSON files for all speaker, sponsor and presentation data, where before this was all hardcoded.

Check out the app on [GitHub](https://github.com/tryswift/trySwiftAppFinal).

#### Others
I have also contributed to repositories, including but not limited to [swift](https://github.com/apple/swift), [swift-evolution](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution), [MGSwipeTableCell](https://github.com/MortimerGoro/MGSwipeTableCell), [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire), and [UIImageColors](https://github.com/jathu/UIImageColors).

These contributions included grammar corrections and syntax highlighting in `README`s and documentation - which I think is a really easy and useful way to contribute to OSS.

> "This last half year we've had some sessions with students from Delta, which we challenged to develop an app showing available rooms where people can discuss things, hold meetings etc.
> It had to explicitly NOT be a reservation system, but a realtime-roomfinder based on the wireless data provided by Fontys. The students were supported and helped by [KPN](http://www.kpn-international.com) (process), [12CU](http://12cu.com) (app development & content), and [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com) (engineering). The result is OK, and will be transferred to Peter Dieteren (Fontys), who is looking into realising the idea in production.
>
> In the group of students, behaviour was fluctuating. Some were fanatical and collaborative, others were clearly less motivated (no preparation, leaving early, etc.). **With great distance, the student Bas Broek was the most valuable and dedicated, and also arranged meetings and the organisation of the product in general. Simply put; the end product would probably not have been here without Bas.**

> Thanks to all students, it was an interesting project for all people involved."

Een aantal waren fanatiek, meewerkend, maar een aantal waren ook duidelijk minder gemotiveerd (hadden niets voorbereid, verlieten de bouwsessies eerder, etc‚Ä¶). Met afstand de meest waardevolle student was Bas Broek, zowel in toewijding, organisatie als in het verzetten van werk. Simpel gezegd, het product wat er nu ligt had er zonder Bas waarschijnlijk niet gelegen.

> "Bas has, during his internship at iCulture, proved to be a valuable addition to the iCulture team. Not only because of his knowledge and skills regarding his project, but also as added value to the editor staff and as "ambience enhancer" in the group. Our wish to keep Bas involved with iCulture is reflected in his high rating and mark."

> "Bas heeft tijdens zijn stage bewezen een zeer waardevolle toevoeging te zijn aan het iCulture team. Niet alleen vanwege zijn kennis en kunde met betrekking tot de invulling van zijn opdracht, maar ook als toegevoegde waarde voor het redactieteam en als sfeermaker binnen de groep. Onze wens om Bas betrokken te houden bij iCulture is gereflecteerd in zijn hoge eindbeoordeling en dito cijfer."
