## Other experience

#### Open Source Software
I ❤️ OSS. The collaboration it enables is truly wonderful. That's why I like
to contribute to projects I use and love, making them even better.

Some projects I have been involved in:

#### [GitHawk](https://itunes.apple.com/app/githawk-for-github/id1252320249)

GitHawk is an iOS app that makes managing GitHub accounts and projects easier.
I've been contributing to this app in a couple of ways, such as improving its
accessibility, writing blog posts and developing new features. As of February
2019, I'm helping lead the project.

Check out the app on [GitHub](https://github.com/rnystrom/GitHawk).

#### [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya)

## Education

### [Fontys University of Applied Sciences](http://fontys.edu) (Eindhoven, 🇳🇱)
#### **September 2013 – July 2017**

At Fontys, I studied ICT & Software, with a focus on Mobile. Here, I have been
working with C#, Java, relational databases, Swift, Java for Android and more.

#### [Delta](http://deltafhict.nl/home/?lang=en)
Delta is a Fontys initiative providing what could be called an excellence
programme for students:

>"Students who participate in the Delta programme work on their own goals and
interests. They work on ‘exploration projects’, where they are given full
freedom to explore a new technology or technique such as Google Glass, Drones,
Virtual Reality and 3D printing. But this can also be collaborating on projects
for real clients."

Here, I made [Opus](http://deltafhict.github.io/mirror-docs/), a Smart Mirror,
making use of technologies such as Leap Motion, Kinect and more. This project
went through a full cycle, from concepting to realisation.
